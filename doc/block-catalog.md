# NoCMS Block Catalog

The catalog is a file created during the installation and setup of gem **nocms-pages**.

Once you executed

 ```ruby
rails g nocms:pages  
 ```

the file **config/initializers/nocms/pages.rb** will be created in your project. This file **contains the catalog**, a nested hash describing the properties of all the blocks you could use with NoCMS.

See more in section **Block layouts** of [nocms-pages README](https://github.com/simplelogica/nocms-pages).
